# MIDI widget powerconsumption 
MIDI Widget offers users insights into power data and MIDI integration while fostering an eco-friendly approach to technology use. The app promotes conscientious computing practices by providing users with the tools to monitor and understand power consumption.

I am not sure if app.zip file works on other computers. If it is after you download it unzip it, then you can use it by clicking right-click Show Package Content and open. This will also open the terminal. It opens in the Mac taskbar where you click start. After that, you need to put the computer password into the terminal. The program can be accessible by creating an IAC Driver in Apple Midi studio.

The program is still in development, only as Python script, tested on MacBook Pro m1 max. In the future, I would like to make it also for Windows.

When opening the taskbar app it freezes because of the limitation of rumps.

It started as a project for the MA Academy of Fine Art project in the interactive design class.
