# MIDI widget powerconsumption 
MIDI Widget offers users insights into power data and MIDI integration while fostering an eco-friendly approach to technology use. The app promotes conscientious computing practices by providing users with the tools to monitor and understand power consumption.

The program is still in development, for now only as Python script, tested on MacBook Pro m1 max. In the future, I would like to make it also for Windows.
The program can be accessible by creating an IAC Driver in Midi studio.
When opening the taskbar app it freezes because of the limitation of rumps.

It started as a project for the MA Academy of Fine Art project in the class of interactive design.
